Anyone can join; everyone can make a difference. Together we can make a positive impact on our world with our everyday lives as we pursue our dreams and share our stories. What extent will you go?

## #WhatExtent will you go?

Simply use the hashtag **#whatextent** in your posts to show the world the extent you're willing to go with the things you care about––your dreams, talents, passions, friends, family, faith, sports, school, career, or just good ole' life in general.
